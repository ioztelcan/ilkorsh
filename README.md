## Ilkorsh Shell
---------------

This is a linux shell I built as a practice. The name refers to a joke between me and 
my close friends from the university but also nicely in line with shell naming (bash, fish, Ksh, etc.).

Right now it is quite limited in functionality, can call commands from /bin directory on Linux systems.

I will probably add further functionality like signal handling, redirection, built-in shell commands etc. Right
now I would not advise using it as your primary shell.
